# GAMAMOD
This is the model repository for the thesis of Philipp Hauser (TU Dresden, Germany).
Two models can be found here on GitHub, GAMAMOD-EU and GAMAMOD-DE. Further background information about the model, data, and application can be found in the thesis.
## GAMAMOD-EU  
The European gas market model **GAMAMOD-EU** depicts the EU-28 in detail and considers non-European pipeline and LNG suppliers. Using an linear programming approach, GAMAMOD-EU optimizes total system costs in the deterministic basic version for one year (365 days). A model extension the stochastic version **GAMAMOD-EU.sto** is done by implementing a two-stage stochastic programming approach. An extensive discussion on the model versions is given in Chapter 5 in the thesis. The data have been documented in the couse of the research project *'Erdgas-BRidGE'*, funded by the BMWi, Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy through the grant 'Erdgas-BRidGE', FKZ: 03ET4055A.

## GAMAMOD-DE
The gas market model for the German gas network **GAMAMOD-DE** focuses on a highly disaggregated natural gas grid representation for Germany with more than 1700 pipelines and 1400 nodes on a daily resolution for one year. Furthermore, the model considers natural gas demand regarding three energy sectors: residential heating, industrial usage, and gas power plant demand. An optional interface to an electricity market model is provided, to integrate individual gas power plant demands. An extensive discussion on the model versions is given in Chapter 8 of the thesis. The used data have been documented in the research project *‘LKD-EU’*, funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy through the grant ‘LKD-EU’, FKZ 03ET4028A-D.
