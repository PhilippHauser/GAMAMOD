# GAMAMOD
This is the model repository for the thesis of Philipp Hauser (TU Dresden, Germany)
Two model codes can be found here on GitHub, GAMAMOD-EU and GAMAMOD-DE.  
## GAMAMOD-EU  
The European gas market model **GAMAMOD-EU** is a European gas market model that depicts the EU-28 in detail and considers non-European pipeline and LNG suppliers. Using an linear programming approach, GAMAMOD-EU optimizes total system costs in the deterministic basic version for one year (365 days). An extensive discussion on the model is given in Chapter 5 of the thesis.
